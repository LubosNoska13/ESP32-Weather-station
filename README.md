# ESP32 Weather-station and Website

## Overview:
Hey there! I'm a passionate student developer, and I want to share my exciting project with you. I've built an ESP32-based weather station. It collects crucial environmental data like *temperature, humidity, CO, CO2, and more*, and securely stores it in a database. But here's the cool part: this data is then beautifully displayed on my website, which runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B+.

## Features:
- **Data Collection**: My weather station does some heavy lifting by collecting real-time data. It's like having your own mini-meteorologist.

- **Web Interface**: I've created a user-friendly website that allows you to log in, create, delete, update, and like posts. Plus, you can view all the data in nifty charts, tailored to specific days.

- **Day or Night**: I'm all about choices. You can switch between dark and light modes on the website, depending on your mood or lighting conditions.

- **Device Compatibility**: No matter if you're using your trusty desktop or your handy smartphone, my website is fully responsive. I want you to access your data anytime, anywhere.

## What's Next:
Currently, I'm taking on a new challenge. I'm working on designing my very own ESP32-S2 with some impressive upgrades:

- **Battery Connection**: Because we don't want power interruptions to mess with our data.

- **SD Card Slot**: Data loss? Not on my watch. An SD card will keep everything safe.

- **RTC (Real-Time Clock):** To keep track of the precise time and date for each data point.

- **Built-In Sensor**: The new ESP32-S2 will monitor temperature, humidity, and more right out of the box. 

It's all about making things easier.

I'm stoked about this project and can't wait to see it all come together. Stay tuned for updates and, if you're as excited as I am, consider giving it a star on GitHub to show your support. Let's make weather data cool and accessible! üí°üå¶Ô∏è
